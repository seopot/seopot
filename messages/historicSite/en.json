Later on, rituals were also performed to honor those who died during the Imogunnan, or the Im-O Military Revolt in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese created a park around the old palaces and historical sites in an attempt to vanquish the spirit of the Korean people following the March 1 Independence Movement, and this was also when the Jangchungdan Park was constructed. Then, in 1932, the Japanese even established Bangmunsa to perform rites to honor Hirobumi Ito. \r\n\r\nThere is a large garden inside the park and it contains a number of cultural heritages such as Jangchungdanbi, Supyogyo Bridge, Seungjeongjeon Hall and Gwangseonmyo as well as the March 1 Independence Movement Monument, a monument with an inscription of a poem by Manhae Han Yong-un, and statues of Yu Gwang-sun, Yi Jun and Kim Yong-hwan. These are all related to the history of Jangchungdan Park. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, this is where you can observe the Supyogyo Bridge, created as a manmade water channel in the Joseon Dynasty. It gained fame as it was featured in the hit drama “The Wild Days.” Perhaps it is because the history of Korea is deeply rooted in this place, but you can also see the Rose of Sharon, the national flower of the Republic of Korea, here.

This means that majority of the work related the establishment of the South Korean government took place at Ihwajang. After resigning the presidency in 1960, the former president stayed at Ihwajang for about a month before moving to Hawaii, where he died. Later, his body was returned to Ihwajang and then buried at the National Ceremony. \r\n\r\nAt present, Ihwajang consists of the President Rhee Syng-man Memorial Hall, History Hall, Sculpture Hall and Living Hall.

Until 1976, he lived in a home in Seongbuk-dong, which can be described to have a simple yet dignified appearance, bearing a resemblance to its former resident. Choi dedicated his life to the promotion of Korean art, together with the Director of the National Museum of Korea, and he gained fame as the author of the book “Leaning Against the Baeheullim Pillar of the Muryangsujeon Hall.” \r\n\r\nHis home became home to Hyegok Choi Sunu Memorial in 2004. This house was on the verge of demolition during the boom of construction of Western-style houses in Seongbuk-dong. However, the National Trust, a civic organization, raised 800 million KRW in December 2002 to purchase the property as Civic Cultural Heritage No. 1 for repair and restoration work. Later in 2006, it was designated as Registered Cultural Heritage No. 268. These efforts were made to honor Choi Sunu and his achievements in promoting Korean art and to preserve the place where he wrote his infamous book. \r\n\r\nThe memorial hall is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. from Tuesday to Saturday between April 1 and Nov. 20 every year. During its closure in winter, the building is cleaned and tidied up to welcome more visitors in the springtime. The main building, main floored room and reception room have Choi’s belongings on display. The reception room, which can be viewed through a window by the visitors, is where he used to read and write books. There, you can see a low desk, a pair of glasses, a camera and manuscripts in Choi’s handwriting that are neatly organized. \r\n\r\nIn the courtyard, there is a well and juniper and pine trees, while the backyard shows exceptional natural beauty. The backyard looks stunning especially in spring and early summer when the flowers are in full bloom and new leaves start to sprout on the trees including maple, bamboo cornelian cherry and persimmon trees. There are various items such as a stone mortar that show the personal taste of Choi and these can be observed throughout the house. Visitors can also sit on a stone and enjoy the scenic view, while having a cup of tea. \r\n\r\n※ For a group of more than 15 individuals, please call (02-3675-3401) a day before the scheduled visit to make a reservation.

However, this was actually the place of many historical events of the Joseon Dynasty. \r\nDeoksugung Palace was originally the personal residence of Wolsan Daegun, the older brother of King Seongjong. Imjinwaerang, or the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, occurred 104 years after his death during the 25th year of King Seonjo’s rule. King Seonjo took refuge in Uiju during which the palaces in Hanseong were completely burnt to the ground. After King Seonjo returned, he looked for a place to stay and he called for a march (Jeongneungdonghaenggun) to the former residence of Wolsan Daegun. That marked the beginning of its history as a temporary palace, and this was where he died in 1593. \r\n\r\nGwanghaegun acceded to the throne, following the death of King Seonjo, at the temporary palace. He then rebuilt Changdeokgung, to which he relocated afterwards, and named the temporary palace Gyeongungung. Later, he held Queen Inmok in confinement inside Gyeongungung, and began to call it Seogung. In 1623, another historic event took place with Gyeongungung as the stage. \r\n\r\nIt was the Injobanjeong, or the revolt for Injo restoration, led by Queen Inok and Seoin to oust Gwanghaegun and crown Neungyanggun as the king. Injo also acceded to the throne at Jeukjodang of Gyeongungung. 8 days after the accession, King Injo moved to Changdeokgung Palace. Afterwards, Gyeongungung became old and worn down as a detached palace. In 1773 during the 49th year of King Yeongjo’s reign, he organized Sabaerye ceremony, reminiscing of King Seonjo, but even still, it still did not play an important role as a palace. \r\n\r\nGyeongungung became an important place of history again during the reign of Emperor Gojong. Following Agwan Pacheon, or the Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation in 1896, he went to Deoksugung instead of Gyeongbokgung, where Empress Myeongseong had been assassinated. This was a part of his attempt to receive assistance from the Western powers and hold the Japanese in check. In that year, he founded the Korean Empire (1897) and Gyeongungung began to regain its prestige as a palace. \r\n\r\nThat didn’t last very long though, as a fire broke out on two occasions. But that was a minor accident compared to the Japanese oppression. In 1905, Eulsajoyak (the Protectorate Treaty between Korea and Japan, which stripped Korea of its rights as an independent nation) was signed at the Jungmyeonjeon of Deoksugung Palace and 2 years later in 1907, Emperor Gojong was forcibly deposed. After Sunjong acceded to the throne, he moved to Changdeokgung and renamed Gyeongungung, where Gojong resided, as Deoksugung Palace. ",

While Gyeonghuigung Palace was the most severely destroyed palace, Changgyeonggung underwent the most devastating transformation by the Japanese. \r\n\r\nFortunately, the zoo was relocated to a different site in 1983 and the palace was once again called Changgyeonggung in the year that marked the 500th anniversary of its erection. \r\n\r\nFollowing the construction of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung was built to the east of Changdeokgung in 1483 under King Seongjong. The foundation was paved by King Sejong, who built Suganggun for Taejong in Changgyeonggung, which had been the site of a detached palace of Goryeo Namgyeong, in the year he acceded to the throne. King Seongjong expanded Suganggung for three queens, Jeonghui the Queen of Sejo, Ansun the Queen of Yejong and Sohye the Queen of Deokjong, and named it Changgyeonggung. Majority of the halls of Changgyeonggung such as Myeongjeonjung, Munjeongjueon, Hwangyeongjeon and Gyeongchunjeon were built at this time. \r\n\r\nChanggyeonggung and Changdeokgung were connected to each other seamlessly and there was no boundary between these two palaces.

Afterwards, as Changdeokgung assumed the role as the main palace of Joseon, the use of Changgyeonggung increased. \r\n\r\nTypically, the main gate to a palace was built on its south side, but Changgyeonggung’s main entrance is located to its east. It is speculated that the location of the main entrance reflects its connection to Changdeokgung. Also, it is shown that the convenience for those residing in the palace was carefully considered in terms of function and purpose of use of the palace. \r\nIn 1830, a fire in Hwangyongjeon Hall destroyed the hall buildings and in 1907, Emperor Gojong was abdicated by the Japanese. Then, the residence of Sunjong was relocated to Changgyeonggung, after which a zoo and a botanical garden were opened to the public here.

Changdeokgung, in particular, was selected for the reason of being an iconic palace in the history of East Asian palace construction that retained its atypical beauty, existing harmoniously with the natural environment and having a superb layout. \r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the area of Changdeokgung is situated on the foothills of Eungbongsan Mountain of Bugaksan Mountain. The palace is recognized for its value as it blended perfectly into the mountainous terrains, and this is characteristic of Korean architecture and landscaping styles. \r\n\r\nThe palace was erected under King Taejong in 1405. It was a detached palace built after the construction of Gyeongbokgung. However, looking at the history of the Joseon Dynasty reveals that it actually served as the political center for the longest time. Unfortunately, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung were both lost during Imjinwaeran, or the Japanese invasion in 1592. \r\n\r\nGyeongbokgung Palace was later abandoned due to the reason of ill fortune, and Changdeokgung, rebuilt in 1610 (2nd year of Gwanghaegun’s rule), served as the political center for 270 years thereafter.

Afterwards, the Japanese demolished Gyeongbokgung Palace under the disguise of restring Changdeokgung. To be more specific, the Gangnyeonjeon and Gyotaejeon of Gyeongbokgung were torn down and the building materials were used to build Huijeongdang and Daejojeon of Changdeokgung.

The palace, for which the construction was completed 3 years after the founding of Joseon in 1395, had 390 rooms and was situated at the heart of Hanyang. It was built based on the pungsujiri (geomancy) principles, with Bugaksan at its rear and the city outside the Gwanghwamun Gate at its front. In front of the palace, there were Namsan Mountain and Cheonggyecheon Stream. It was regarded as the perfect site for an imperial palace that symbolized the power and authority of the new dynasty. \r\n\r\nAfter a careful consideration, Jeong Do-jeong gave the palace the name, Gyeongbokgung, which meant that “the new dynasty [would] enjoy good fortune and prosperity.” Perhaps it was this brilliant name, but the Joseon Dynasty lasted for more than 600 years, but Gyeongbokgung Palace, unfortunately, did not share the same fate. \r\n\r\nIn 1553, a fire broke out for the first time at Gyeongbokgung Palace, specifically in Gangnyeongjeon. The fire spread and engulfed majority of the area in the north part of Geunjeongjeon before it was suppressed. The entire palace was not burnt down, fortunately, and the restoration work commenced in the following year. It is speculated that Gyeongbokgung Palace was completely burnt down by the Japanese during the invasion in 1592. After the war, it was believed that the site had bad fortune and Changdeokgung Palace was designated as the political center. \r\n\r\nGyeongbokgung Palace was resurrected 270 years later in 1867 by Heungseong Daewongun, who rebuilt the palace to contain 330 buildings and 7,225 rooms. However, this was the final hey-day of Gyeongbokgung, ever seen by the Joseon Dynasty. In 1876, a massive fire broke out and destroyed most of the buildings including Gyotaejeon. Ultimately, the political center of the Joseon Dynasty gradually became dissolved and destroyed into pieces after the annexation of Korea by the Japanese. \r\n\r\nIn 1915, Joseon Mulsan Gongjinhoe (Joseon Products Show) was held and 90% of the royal palace was demolished. When a fire occurred at Changdeokgung Palace in 1917, Gyeongbokgung was demolished to use the building materials to rebuild the buildings of Changdeokgung. Gwanghwamun, which was the main gate of Gyeongbokgung, was even moved to the north of the Cheongchunmun Gate. In 1926, the Japanese Government General of Korea took office in front of Geunjeongjeon, and an art museum was established in Geoncheonggung. ",

The area contains Hongjimun Gate of Tangchundaeseong Fortress, which bridges Seoul City Wall and Bukhansan Fortress, as well as the site of Yi Gwang-su’s vacation home, Seokparang, Segeomjeong, site of Tangchundae, site of Jojiseo and more. \r\n\r\nSegeomjeong, situated in the upstream of Hongjecheon, is the final destination point of a trekking course leading up to Inwangsan and Bugaksan mountains and displays an infusion of modern and traditional elements. \r\n\r\nThere are diverse stories providing an explanation of how it came to be called Seogeomjeong. The most plausible story is related to Injobanjeong, or the coup d`etat for Injo restoration, which took place in 1623. The rebel forces including Yi Gwi and Kim Ryu gathered together at Hongjewon and made segeomibui pledges (to wash the swords for righteousness) for a revolt. Aftewards, they established Segeomjeong to commemorate their successful revolt. Segeomjeong is in the form of a pavilion with a gambrel roof. According to the records, it was rebuilt in 1747 (23rd Year of King Yeongjo’s reign) and destroyed in 1941 before being restored to its present-day appearance in 1977. \r\n\r\nThe area around Segeomjeong, through which Hongjecheon Stream flows, is famous for its breathtaking scenery extending all the way to Baegundae on the southern foothills of Bugaksan Mountain. In the recent years, it has emerged as a popular tourist attraction in Seoul with the rustic environment of Pyeongchang-dong, Gugi-dong, Hongji-dong and Buam-dong as well as quaint cafes and restaurants captivating the visitors.

In the year of poor harvests, the King came here to perform a ritual in tears. “Sa” and “jik” mean the “god of earth” and “god of grains,” respectively, and Sajikdan Altar was the place where rites was performed before these gods to pray for abundant harvests. The first places established by King Taejo of Joseon after relocating the capital to Hanyang were Jongmyo Shrine and Sajikdan Altar, which attest to their importance in the past. \r\n\r\nSajikdan Altar is surrounded by walls forming a square shape. There are four gates at the center facing the north, south, west and east, with an altar constructed on the east side for rituals performed for the god of earth and an altar constructed on the west for rituals performed for the god of grains. Stone pillars were erected on the altars to be oriented toward these two gods. At the Sajikdan Altar, four major ceremonies, as well as ceremonies wishing for abundant harvest and rain and offering the first harvest of the season to the gods were held. Of particular note, Sajik-daeje great ceremony was held every September. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpon passing through the entrance, you will come across the main gate which has been designated as National Treasure No. 177. This is the first gate to the altar, where offerings were presented to the gods of earth and grains. Sajikdan Altar is a single-story structure with 3 front faces and 2 sides that is 57.42m2 in area. Sinsil Room was destroyed during Imjinwaeran, or the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, and it was restored only near the end of King Seonjo’s rain. It was repaired on several occasions. \r\n\r\nSinmun Gate was pushed 14m back from its original site during the road expansion project in 1962. A grand garden was created at the center of the site and the main gate was erected on top of the Jangdaeseokgidan Altar to prevent trespassers and mark that it is a sacred place. \r\n\r\nBehind the altar is the Sadang Dangun Shrine, beyond which one can see Hwanghakjeong. In 1922, under the command of Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire, who wished to continue on the practice of court archery Hwanghakjeong, which had been located in the north of Hoesangjeon of Gyeonghuigung Palace, was relocated to the site of Deunggwajeong, where archery training was given. With several public buildings such as the Jongno Library and Children’s Public Library and a dense forest of trees, the park is frequented by citizens, who come to this place to relax and to learn about history.

Inside, the chronology of Hong’s life as well as his photographs and music sheets are on display. \r\n\r\nHong gained fame for his exquisite compositions including Bongseonhwa (Garden Balsam) and Seongbulsaui Bam (Night at Seongbulsa Temple) and Korea’s first violinist. He played the first violin at Tokyo Symphony Orchestra and served as a managing director at the Joseon Musicians Association. Of particular note, the music he composed reflected the sentiments unique to Koreans and it was widely loved by people around the nation. However, many feel disappointed in the fact that he took part in pro-Japanese organizations such as the Joseon Musicians Association. \r\n\r\nPast the statue of Hong Nan-pa, one can enter his former home, which is reminiscent of a fairy tale. There, you will be able to see photographs of Hong, taken with his students and family. Also, the music score for Gohyangui Bom (Spring of My Hometown) engraved on a wooden block and the music sheet for Bongseonhwa that has faded away are also on display. \r\n\r\nThe red brick house, which is covered by ivy, has been demonstrating exquisite architectural beauty and value over time. Built in contemporary Western style by a German missionary in 1930, granite stone was used to create the foundation and the bricks were processed so as to accentuate their rough surfaces, which is characteristic of the Renaissance rustication technique. \r\n\r\nThe vertical windows also add a classic beauty to the house, and the cozy atmosphere emanated inside the house is also impressive. The areas which used to be the main bedroom and living room are now used as exhibition spaces and also as a stage for small-scale music performances. \r\n\r\nHong’s former home, which had been privately owned, was bought by Jongno-gu. Afterwards, a sound system was installed and foldable chairs were placed here to turn it into a venue for music performances that can accommodate about 50 people.

It was built by the Independence Association in 1897. \r\n\r\nIt was originally the site of Yeongeunmun Gate, the symbol of diplomacy, welcoming the envoys from China, but the gate was demolished to demonstrate the resolution for independence. It resembles the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and although it does not have a refined appearance, it shows people’s wish for independence and autonomous sovereignty. Its name, Dongnimmun, is written in both Korean and Sino-Korean, and the national flag on its left and right further emphasize the desire for independence. The plinths of Yeongeunmun Gate designated as Historic Site No. 33 stand in front of the gate. \r\n\r\nRepair work was performed in 1917 and 1928, and it was relocated 70m away to the northwest of its original site due to the construction of Seongsan-daero in 1979. On August 15, 1992, Seodaemun Independence Park containing the Seodaemun Prison, Independence Hall and Memorial Tower for the Patriotic Martyrs opened its doors. After that, it became a popular tourist site, attracting nearly 500,000 tourists every year. \r\n\r\nOver time, however, the nearby facilities became damaged and worn down. Also, it received criticisms that the foreign species of trees towering behind the March 1 Independence Declaration Memorial Tower and the boxwood tree and the Japanese-style pond near the gate were in conflict with its significance as a place, commemorating the independence of Korea. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, a project was undertaken to transform the independence park as a place that is befitting of its name, and as a result, a 10,000㎡ square called the Independence Yard was created. The newly created park also contained a traditional form of ponds in Korea called Bangji which is squared-shaped. Also, the trees which were landscaped in Japanese style were replaced with the native trees of Korea such as pine trees. Through the reconstruction project, the elements of Japanese culture and style were completely eliminated and the essence of Korean beauty and history was displayed by the park. \r\n\r\nThe Independence Park, which has transformed into a symbolic historical park, has emerged as an educational ground that’s easily accessible and contains advanced facilities for the convenience of visitors.

It was the gate to Tangchundaeseong Fortress, built to serve as a bridge between Seoul City Wall and Bukhansanseong Fortree in the 41th year of King Sukjong’s reign. \r\n\r\nHongjimun Gate was also called Hanbukmun, meaning the gate north to Hanseong, but Hongjimun became the official designation after King Sukjong wrote Hongjimun on the signboard. The gate was destroyed due to a flood in 1921 and it was restored by the Seoul City Wall Restoration Committee in 1977. The signboard for the gate was handwritten by the then-president Park Chung-hee. \r\n\r\nHongjimun is characterized by 6 axes in the form of hongye, which is a rainbow-shaped arch, with a single-story gate tower with 3 front sides and 2 sides on the roof. Side doors were made on the left and right sides of the tower and a stone wall created as an enclosure. A door with a steel ornament in the shape of hongye was installed in the front and rear sides, and a stairway was built inside. \r\n\r\nThe low city wall connected to the Hongjimun Gate is the starting point of Tangchundaeseong Fortress, which bridges Seoul City Wall and the Bukhansan Fortress. It was constructed after Imjinwaeran, or the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, and Byeongjahoran, or the invasion of the Manchus in 1636, to defend the city against foreign invasions. Seoul City Wall extends 4km from the peak of Inwangsan Mountain through the Hongjimun Gate to Suribong Peak below the Bibong Peak of Bukhansan Mountain. It’s been said that the fortress was named after Tangchundae, which was a playground of Yeonsangun. \r\n\r\nTangchundaeseong is characterized by two types of terrains which are separated by Hongjimun Gate and Ogandaesumun Floodgate. The southwest part of the fortress was constructed along the ridge extending from Inwangsan Mountain, while the northeast part extends toward the Bibong Peak along the Tanchungdae Ridge of the Bukhansan National Park. \r\n\r\nThe ridge is a trail exhibiting gentle slopes and thus it is easy to hike for everyone. It is also a place where people can explore the history of Korea. It is easy to access this area from Sangmyung University, Gugi Tunnel or Hongeun-dong. ",
